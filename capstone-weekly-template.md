# Part B – Weekly Capstone Assignment Template

This template is used for **each of the 14 Part B capstone submissions** throughout the semester. The structure remains the same every week so that you can focus on *thinking and judgment*, not guessing expectations.

Your goal is not to achieve the best performance, but to **reason carefully about how this week’s machine learning technique applies (or does not apply) to your project**.

---

## 1. Project Context (Brief)

Provide the same short context each week so graders can orient quickly.

* **Project Title: Predicting MLB Home Run Season Totals**
* **Data Modality: Tabular** 
* **Task Type: Regression** 
* **One-Sentence Goal:** Predict the number of home runs the top players will hit in an upcoming MLB season based on their age, experience, recent performance, and historical playing time patterns.

---

## 2. This Week’s Technique and Its Assumptions - N/A

* **Technique / Model Family Covered This Week:**
* **Key Assumptions of This Technique:** (1–2 bullets)

**Fit Assessment (required):**

> I expect this technique to be a **good / partial / poor** fit for my project because:

(2–4 sentences)

---

## 3. Representation or Proxy Used - N/A

Describe how your data was represented so that this week’s technique could be applied.

Examples include:

* Hand-engineered features

* Summary statistics

* Frozen embeddings

* Dimensionality reduction

* A proxy task

* **Representation or Proxy Chosen:**

* **Why this representation was reasonable for this week:**

---

## 4. What Was Attempted

Be concrete and scoped. Do not list everything you *could* have done.

* What you implemented this week
- Initialized the working notebook for my personal project, and decided on a tentative data set to focus on.
* What you intentionally did *not* attempt and why
- Any actual "Machine Learning" or training, as we have not gotten there yet.
* Any constraints encountered (data, labels, compute, time)
- Could not easily find some of the data I wanted.

---

## 5. Results or Observations - N/A

You may include metrics **if applicable**, but qualitative observations are also valid.

Examples:

* Evaluation metrics
* Training behavior or convergence issues
* Error patterns
* Unexpected behaviors

---

## 6. Interpretation and Judgment - N/A

This section matters most.

Reflect on:

* Why the method behaved as it did
* Which assumptions held or failed
* What this reveals about your data or problem framing

(1–2 thoughtful paragraphs)

---

## 7. Forward-Looking Adjustment

Answer **one** of the following:

* What will you keep, change, or discard before the next assignment?
* What would you try next if data or resources were not constrained?
- I would adjust the dataset to include more points I want to train the model on.

---

## 8. Mismatch Acknowledgment (Complete Only If Applicable) - N/A

If this week’s technique was a poor fit, explain:

* Why it does not align with your project
* Evidence supporting that conclusion
* What value this attempt still provided

---

## Submission Notes

* Written submission format: **Markdown or PDF**
* Code or notebooks: **optional unless explicitly requested**
* Performance is **not** graded competitively
* Clear reasoning and honest reflection matter more than results
